Graph Theory: Maximum Matching
==============================

This repository have study purpose only.

We intent to implement two Maximum Matching algorithms. Firstly, Khun algorithm for poundered graphs and then Micali and Vazirani's approach for general graphs. 

Command Line Argument
---------------------

The program takes one command line argument, which is optional and represents the name of the file where the Graph definitions is.
